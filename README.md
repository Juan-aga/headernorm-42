# headernorm-42
## Description:
"headernorm" is a bash script that checks the headers of all .c and .h files in the current directory and its subdirectories. It also passes the norminette, a code style checker used in the 42 cursus.

## Features:
Check file ownership: The script verifies if the files were created and uploaded by a single user. It displays an "OK" message if there is only one user associated with the files. If there are multiple users, it shows a warning message along with the usernames of those who created or uploaded the files.

Norminette check: The script also checks the norminette to ensure code compliance. If everything is in order, it displays a success message. In case of any issues with the norm, it shows a warning message and provides details of the norm violations.

## Usage:
Execute the script: Run the script by executing it in the desired directory.

### Alias setup: 
To simplify the usage, you can add an alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc) so that you can call it like the norminette. Here's an example alias setup:

```
alias headernorm="bash /path/to/headernorm.sh"
```
Note: Replace "/path/to/headernorm-42.sh" with the actual path to the "headernorm-42.sh" script.

## Requirements:
Bash shell environment
Norminette (ensure it is installed and available in the system's PATH)
